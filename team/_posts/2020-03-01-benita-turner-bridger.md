I am a postdoc in the Znamenskiy lab interested in understanding how specific neurons are specialised during development to relay information across the brain. In my project I investigate the molecular basis for specifying long-range wiring patterns from the primary visual cortex.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences (honouring in Physiology) at the University of Edinburgh. I then went on to Cambridge University, where I joined the Welcome Trust PhD Programme in Developmental Mechanisms and completed a PhD in Developmental Neurobiology mentored by Prof. Christine Holt.
