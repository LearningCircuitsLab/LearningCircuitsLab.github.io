I studied Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of Santiago de Compostela (2003 – 2008), a Msc in Biomedicine (2009-2010) and PhD in Pharmacology and Toxicology (2010-2015), in the same university. I moved to King’s College London in 2016, where I had the opportunity to work as a Research Technician and Research Assistant at Matt Grubb’s laboratory, at the Centre for Developmental Neurobiology. We worked in neurodegeneration in the olfactory bulb and neuronal plasticity
I moved to the gene therapy start-up Axovia Therapeutics in 2021, where I worked as a Senior Scientist. In 2022 I moved to The Francis Crick Institute, where I worked as a Senior Laboratory Research Scientist at Johannes Kohl laboratory, focused in neuronal changes linked to pregnancy.
In 2023 I moved to Barcelona, and I started to work as a Senior Technician in the Nanobioengineering Group at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), focused on Blood Brain Barrier in Organ-on-a-chip technologies. In 2025 I moved to the Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), where I started to work as a Lab Manager in the Brain Circuits and Behavior Laboratory and in the Learning Circuits Laboratory.
