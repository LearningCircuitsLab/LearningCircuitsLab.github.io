I majored in Clinical Medicine at the undergraduate level at Hebei University (2016–2021). Driven by my interest in neuroscience, I transferred to Southern Medical University (2021–2024) to pursue a Master's degree, where my research focused on the neural mechanisms underlying depth perception using in vivo calcium imaging.
In 2025, I joined the lab as a PhD student, working on the specific circuits through which the basal ganglia control behavior in mice.
I am interested in hardware control and its application in solving scientific problems.
