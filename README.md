# znamlab.github.io
Lab website of the Specification and Function of Neural Circuits Laboratory at
the Francis Crick Institute.

## Updating your personal info
You will find your personal page under `team/_posts`. The file name should start
with your start date in the lab -- this is to ensure that lab members appear on
the team page in order of joining.

The lab member files have the following header (I am using mine as an example):

`---
layout: member
title: Petr Znamenskiy
photo: Petr.jpg
info: Group Leader
email: petr.znamenskiy@crick.ac.uk
github: znamensk
twitter: petrzzz
scholar: "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tZ3hWEYAAAAJ"
link_to_page: yes
---`

Any of the fields except `title` and `info` can be omitted or left blank, in which
case the relevant item wont appear on the website. If you omit `link_to_page`
or leave it blank, the [team page](https://znamlab.org/team/) wont link to your
personal page.

Photos should be square and placed under `images/members` in the repo.
