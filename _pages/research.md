## Molecular mechanisms of cortical wiring

The neocortex contains a multitude of cell-types, which follow different rules in
selecting their inputs and outputs that ultimately define their role in the circuit.
We are interested in understanding how the gene expression programs of these cell
types help to establish these intricate connectivity rules.

To answer this question we focus on excitatory projection neurons in primary
visual cortex (V1), which convey information about the visual scene to other
regions of the brain. V1 neurons projecting to different long-range targets receive
different synaptic inputs and have distinct preferences for visual stimuli. We
are aiming to understand how V1 neurons select where to send their projections
and acquire their specialized response properties. To this end, we are
developing new tools to manipulate gene expression and assay connectivity and
functional properties of thousands of neurons in parallel.

## Connectomics

One of the major obstacles toward understanding how the properties of neurons
arise from the structure of their synaptic connections is the lack of tools to
probe neuronal connectivity in a scalable manner. Existing approaches, such as
serial electron microscopy or multiple patch clamp recordings, are extremely
labor-intensive and largely limited to probing local connections.

To overcome these limitations, we are working on new ways of
using molecular methods to read out neuronal connectivity and relate it to
gene expression in individual neurons.

## Vision in three dimensions

Among all the senses, vision is exceptionally attuned to provide detailed information about
the three-dimensional structure of the environment. However, the visual signals
available to the brain are limited to the two-dimensional images formed on the
retinae and the visual system must infer the missing depth information. The
ethological importance of these computations is illustrated by the fact that
capacity for depth perception appears to be innate in many vertebrates and not
dependent on visual experience. This suggests that evolution has imbued the visual
system with hard-wired circuits for depth perception.

Aiming to understand the circuit basis of these computations, we are studying how
neurons in the visual cortex encode the three-dimensional location of visual cues
in virtual and augmented reality environments using two-photon
calcium imaging and high-density electrophysiology ([Neuropixels probes](https://www.neuropixels.org/)).
