# About this website

This website is largely based on the [template](https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab) provided by [the Allan lab](http://www.allanlab.org/). It is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and uses some [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) and [Bootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com). The code is maintained on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) for version control and is hosted on [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/).
